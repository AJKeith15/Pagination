 Treehouse Full Stack TechDegree Project 2

This application displays a list of students that is divided into pages of 10 students
each. At the bottom of the page are links to all pages that have been created from
the student list. At the top is a search function that will search all student names
and return a new set of pages based on the search results.

This project was a test of DOM navigation. The student list needed to be sorted,
and pages needed to be displayed based on hard-coded HTML which required searching
through the HTML document using the DOM.
